## About  
This dashboard leverages data from the General Social Survey (GSS), a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago since 1972. It presents a detailed analysis of income alongside other key socioeconomic indicators such as gender, age, education level, and more. Featuring two interactive visualizations, the dashboard allows users to customize views according to their specific interests and analytical needs.  
## Building Process and Data Science Concepts  
My process for building the dashboard involved several key steps to enhance data accessibility and user interaction. Initially, I filtered the dataset to ensure clarity and relevance in the visualizations. I then employed various chart types, such as scatter plots and stacked bar graphs, to effectively depict different aspects of the data. To facilitate time series analysis, I integrated a year slider that allows users to observe trends over time, thereby enabling analysis based on long-term data rather than isolated snapshots.

In terms of UI/UX design, I focused on creating an interactive and user-driven interface. I included multiple dropdown menus to enable users to filter data based on criteria such as gender, age, and education level. Furthermore, I implemented theme customization options, including light and dark modes, enhancing visual comfort and personalization. Users can switch themes via a button and interact with the graphs to select which data categories are displayed.

Aesthetically, I aimed for a clean and organized layout, adhering to a consistent color scheme and arranging content in a somewhat grid format to optimize visual appeal. All information is neatly organized into two tabs, allowing for a comprehensive overview without the need to scroll, ensuring a user-friendly experience across the dashboard.  
## Strengths and Learning Experiences  
In developing an interactive dashboard for analyzing socio-economic data, I improved key technical skills and gained valuable experience that would be beneficial to future roles. My work involved managing and filtering complex datasets, and employing advanced data visualization tools to create dynamic, user-friendly visualizations such as scatter plots, stacked bar graphs, and time series analyses. This process sharpened my proficiency with data science tools and techniques, enhancing my ability to translate raw data into insightful visualizations.

Furthermore, I focused on integrating responsive UI/UX design elements, including customizable features like theme toggling and interactive data filters, which fostered a deeper understanding of user-centered design principles. This approach not only improved user engagement but also ensured accessibility and ease of use. The project management aspect of the dashboard development taught me to effectively plan and execute complex projects, refining my problem-solving skills and my ability to deliver a polished, impactful product. Overall, this experience has significantly strengthened my capabilities in data visualization, UI/UX design, and strategic project execution, making me well-prepared to contribute to data-driven decision-making in future roles.
